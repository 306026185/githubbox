## What

Suppose you're on `github.com` looking at a repo.

Now you want to explore the code of that repo in a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/).

Just add **box** to your url and the repo will open there.

## Try

As you're on GitHub at the moment, you can add `box` to the current URL.

```diff
-https://github.com/dferber90/githubbox
+https://githubbox.com/dferber90/githubbox
```

You'll then see this README on CodeSandbox.

_This also works when you're on a branch, a tag or on a file's blob._

## Lazy
